# Project Title

CI/CD Pipeline for Golden Image Creation

## Overview

This project establishes an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, and AWS for the seamless creation of a golden image. The golden image serves as a standardized template for deploying applications in an AWS environment, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and reliability in the deployment process.

## Project Structure

- Packer configuration file for creating the golden image.
- Shell script to install required dependencies.
- Jenkins pipeline script.

## Prerequisites
